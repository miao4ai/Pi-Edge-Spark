# ğŸ§  Pi-Edge-Spark  
**Edge-Orchestrated Data Processing with Apache Spark on Raspberry Pi**

---

## ğŸ“˜ Overview
**Pi-Edge-Spark** demonstrates how to use **Apache Spark** as a central orchestrator to coordinate multiple **edge-computing devices** (such as Raspberry Pi) for distributed **data cleaning, preprocessing, and aggregation**.

Instead of sending all raw data to the cloud, each edge node performs lightweight ETL locally â€” reducing bandwidth and latency â€” while Spark manages job distribution and global analytics.

> ğŸ’¡ Goal: Build a mini **Edge-Cloud Collaborative Data Pipeline** powered by Spark + Python.
